## Preamble

The creation of Free Software is experiencing an unbroken boom due to the general availability of the Internet and the resulting network effects. The number of people involved in development of Free Software is growing exponentially. Effective collaboration in larger, international and geographically separated groups has only become possible with the introduction of new software tools and collaboration platforms.

While the dominating software tools which made this collaboration possible were developed as Free and Open Software (a good example is "GIT"), the succeeding collaboration tools are proprietary online services of commercial companies, which are mostly operating under US law. This lead to the paradox situation that millions of volunteers create knowledge, text contributions and software of unrecognizable value while the control is handed over to these commercial platforms. 

The non-profit and free as Open-Source developed code which makes our modern communication in the Internet and the connected life possible, even the products of publicly funded science, are inserted into private and commercially operating platforms, whose software and stock cannot be controlled from outside, whose control is not even attempted.

As Codeberg e. V., we are convinced that the process of software creation, the documentation and communication in which developers of Free Software participate deserve a likewise free and non-profit operating platform, to guarantee the openness and the availability of free software for all future.

Therefore, the purpose of Codeberg e. V. is the creation and operation of a free collaboration platform for the creation, archiving and preservation of code and the documents of its development processes, as well as the improvement, customization and integration of already existing free software tools for making this platform possible. Dependencies on external and proprietary services for the operation of the platform are specifically avoided in order to not endanger the independence, autonomy and existence of the platform.
